# Dashboards

The platform dashboard set. Each JSON file is a `configMapGenerator` entry in
`kustomization.yaml`; the Grafana sidecar picks the ConfigMaps up by their
`grafana_dashboard: "1"` label and files them by the `grafana_folder`
annotation.

## Provenance

`source` is the grafana.com dashboard id for an import, or `hand-written` for a
dashboard maintained in this repo. `schema / version` are the values inside the
file, so a re-import that changes them shows up in the diff.

| File | Source | schema / version | Local changes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `adguard.json` | grafana.com 20799 (revision not recorded) | 41 / 10 | uid `adguard-weisssrv`; datasource refs pinned to uid `prometheus`; tags dns/adguard/networking; timezone `browser` |
| `alertmanager-self.json` | grafana.com 9578 (rev 4) | 39 / 28 | uid `alertmanager-self`; datasource refs pinned to uid `prometheus`; materialized repeat clones removed; every selector scoped by the `$pod` variable; memory limit overlay added; a collapsed `Cluster (gossip)` row added; timezone `browser` |
| `node-exporter-full.json` | grafana.com 1860 (rev 45) | 41 / 101 | uid `node-exporter-full`; `__inputs`/`__requires` stripped and datasource refs pinned to uid `prometheus`; tags and a `now-6h` default range; the IRQ Detail, TCP Stat Persistent, TCP Stat Transient and TCP Socket Queue panels removed and the `node_pressure_irq_stalled_seconds_total` and `node_netstat_Tcp_MaxConn` targets dropped, because those collectors are off; Entropy moved to x=0 to close the gap IRQ Detail left |

A re-import downloads
`https://grafana.com/api/dashboards/<id>/revisions/<rev>/download`, re-applies
the Local changes column, and bumps the recorded revision here. Diff the current
file against the revision you are moving from, so those changes carry forward
instead of being rediscovered.

## What a new dashboard must satisfy

- Every datasource ref is pinned to uid `prometheus` (or `loki`). The chart
  fixes those uids, so a dashboard carrying an exported uid loads broken.
- The `uid` is stable and unique, and never changes after the first import. The
  sidecar keys the ConfigMap to the dashboard on it, which is also why
  `kustomization.yaml` sets `disableNameSuffixHash: true`. The uid need not
  match the file name.
- `"timezone": "browser"`, so every dashboard in the set renders timestamps the
  same way.
